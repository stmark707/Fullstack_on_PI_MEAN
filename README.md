# Fullstack_on_PI_MEAN
Full stack on Raspberry Pi using the MEAN technology stack. (Mongo Database, Express, Angular, Node)

I am creating a full stack web application using a raspberry pi 4. Although, the
Raspberry Pi is set up like a desk top, I will be programming it through SSH.
The sensor will be connected to the GPIO pins. This sensor monitors temperature and humidity.

List of hardware components:
	1. Raspberry Pi 4
	2. Raspberry pi 4 Screen 10.1 (1280x800)
	3. HiLetgo DHT22

I will update the read me as the project progresses.

###UPDATE 2/8/2022###

Completed task:
	1. Created a wiring diagram to display the connection between the DHT22 and Raspberry Pi
	2. Integrated GPIO and sensor Libraries
	3. Wrote the program to receive readings from the sensor

Completed task:
	1. Made a responsive web mockup on figma
	2. Using a script to update the values every 2 seconds on the GUI
	3. Implemented the mockup on local server, will add responsive changes at a later time.

This is a mockup of the mobile version of the site. The main changes are the layout and the navigation bar.

This is what the GUI currently looks like on a desktop. 

The architecture of the system has not been finalized and I have not created a diagram for it.
